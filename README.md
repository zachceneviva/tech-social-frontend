# About Techonnect
Techonnect is a social media web application tailored towards professionals in the tech industry or hoping to break into the tech industry. While all tech professionals are welcome to join the platform, it is a great place for aspiring professionals to connect, collaborate, and share. Users are able to network, plan meetups, start groups, ask for project feedback, share work, and more.

The inspiration for this project comes from my time in a software engineering bootcamp. I quickly became aware of the amazing community that my bootcamp fostered. While I was able to network and connect with many current and previous bootcamp grads via LinkedIn, I realized these individuals were only from the specific bootcamp I had graduated from. Techonnect is inspired by this community of professionals. By giving tech professionals a dedicated platform, I hope the community I found in my specific bootcamp can be grown to give current and aspiring tech professionals a strong network.
